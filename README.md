##Born Ready Mobile Application README

Overview:
Born Ready is a mobile application designed to assist expecting parents childproof their homes. The user is provided with a checklist of items, sorted by rooms in the house of things to childproof in the home, as directed by the app. The user can check a box once that element has been childproofed. The program enables users to save their progress.

###Technical Overview:
Born Ready is an app that needed to be coded from scratch. The images, which were provided, were created in PowerPoint, and only needed to be ungrouped and saved as .png files. 

In two weeks, we plan to create a checklist app that can communicate with a server and save users’ results. There are PowerPoint wireframes available for our reference. In addition, the app will likely use HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript to develop the checklist app and then use Ratchet and PhoneGap to convert it to other platforms.

###Deliverables

Completion of this project will allow users to use the Born Ready app to perform the following actions:

	•	Marking items as completed
	•	Marking items as not applicable
	•	Unmarking items
	• 	Save progress 

Aesthetics and UX will be designed on best-effort basis.

###Scope

For this two-week project the following items are in scope:

	•	The user will be able to mark items as completed by checking a relevant checkbox.
	•	The user will be able to mark an already completed item as incomplete by unchecking a relevant checkbox.
	•	The user will be able to mark items as not applicable by checking a relevant box.
	•	Completed items will be shown differently from pending items.

The following items are out of scope:

	•	Multiple user accounts / logging in
	•	Grouping pending items.
	•	Security
	•	Deleting items
	•	QR/Barcode scanner to check for recalls
	•	Social media aspect, i.e. the ability to share the completed checklist via Facebook
	

###Technology Stack

	•	Node.js for server side programming
	•	JavaScript with jQuery for client side programming
	•	Bootstrap for basic styling and responsive layout
	•	Ratchet for mobile app functionality
	•	PhoneGap to support multiple platforms

##How We Developed It

###Overview

This mobile app is a joint project between Venture School and DevIowa. Venture School is an entrepreneurial summer school program, while DevIowa is a 9-week, full-stack coding bootcamp. Both are offered through the University of Iowa's John Pappajohn Entrepreneurial Center.

This app was the brainchild of the Born Ready team at the Venture School. The app is designed to educate expecting parents and help them childproof their home. Through a series of checklists, the app allows users to go from room to room in the home, view items that need to be childproofed and use a checklist to cross those items off a to-do list once completed. 

For example, the guide.html page provides a list of several rooms commonly found in the home, such as kitchen, living room, garage and nursery. Users walk into their kitchen, click on the kitchen link in the app, and a checklist of items to childproof appears. One of the kitchen checklist items is "Remove magnets from refrigerator." Once the user has completed the task, they click the box and it is checkmarked. If the user does not have magnets, they can click again, to a "non-applicable" setting. The app saves the info so users can return to their saved settings at a later time. 

Kelsey Smithart and Nico Aguilar from the Venture School pitched the app idea to the DevIowa class. The greatest strength of the app included:
	• Kelsey has a master's of science degree in occupational safety and ergonomics, wanted to create an app that would not only educate expecting parents on childproofing, but would also provide the lastest scientific research on childproofing and child safety in the home.  
	• Nico (who has a master's degree in health administration and public health policy) meticulously created the images for the app using PowerPoint. Yes, PowerPoint. 
	• The team had a well-developed graphic design and wireframe for the project. 

This app was developed by Linda Oyolu and Gigi Wood. Linda did the heavy lifting, working through the most difficult code and solve the most challenging JavaScript issues with our DevIowa instructors. Gigi was more of a co-pilot, who asked a lot of questions and stumbled through CSS and basic JavaScript before banging her head on the wall and finally, asking for assistance.  

###App Development
Linda and Gigi started out by creating all the basic files needed: the index.html page, data.js and data.json pages, package.json file and the css stylesheet. As they slowly added code to those basic files, Linda spent her free-time taking the PowerPoint images, separating them from the files and saving them as .png files to be used for the app.
